      <p className="max-w-3xl text-center mx-auto text-slate-300">
        As a senior Computer Science student at Stockton University, I’ve spent
        the past several years building a strong foundation in both theory and
        practical application. My academic journey has pushed me to think
        critically, solve complex problems, and approach challenges with a
        structured, analytical mindset.

      <p className="max-w-3xl text-center mx-auto mt-4 text-slate-300">
        My primary focus lies in software engineering and system architecture. I
        enjoy designing solutions that are not only functional but scalable,
        maintainable, and grounded in real‑world use cases. Whether I’m working
        on backend systems, experimenting with new frameworks, or collaborating
        on team projects, I’m driven by the excitement of turning ideas into
        working software.
      </p>

      <p className="max-w-3xl text-center mx-auto mt-4 text-slate-300">
        Outside of academics and coding, I make time for the hobbies that keep
        me balanced and inspired. Hiking lets me disconnect and explore new
        trails, while video games tap into my love for strategy, creativity, and
        immersive storytelling.
